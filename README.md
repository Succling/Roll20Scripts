Welcome to my quaint collection of Roll20 scripts I made... you're free to use them as you like, I try to make these as generic as possible but sometimes some mechanics are so niche to my campaign that you may have no use for some of these scripts... alas!
# How to add scripts
To add a script, go on Roll20 and select your campaign, then press on `Mod (API) Scripts`, you will be taken to a new site with a console.

Press on `New Script` and name the file accordingly (you don't have to do this you can just put in whatever, but I'd name these just like my original source file...).

Copy the code from the source here in GitHub and paste it, it should look like this now:

After you pasted the code simply click on `Save Script` below the code block, the console below that button should now signifiy that it is restarting the sandbox, that's it! The script should now fully work.
